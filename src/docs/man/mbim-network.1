Notes:
.IP
1) [DEVICE] is given as the full path to the cdc\-wdm character
device, e.g.:
.IP
\fI\,/dev/cdc\-wdm0\/\fP
.IP
2) The mbim\-network script requires a profile to work. Unless
explicitly specified with `\-\-profile', the file is assumed to
be available in the following path:
.IP
\fI\,/etc/mbim\-network.conf\/\fP
.IP
3) The APN to use should be configured in the profile, in the
following way (e.g. assuming APN is called 'internet'):
.IP
APN=internet
.IP
4) Optional APN user/password strings may be given in the
following way:
.IP
APN_USER=user
APN_PASS=password
.IP
5) If APN user/password is specified, the authentication protocol
to use (one of PAP, CHAP or MSCHAPV2) must also be specified in
the following way:
.IP
APN_AUTH=protocol
.IP
6) If you want to instruct the mbim\-network script to use the
mbim\-proxy setup, you can do so by configuring the following line
in the profile:
.IP
PROXY=yes
.IP
7) Once the mbim\-network script reports a successful connection
you still need to run a DHCP client on the associated WWAN network
interface.
